# Long-non-coding-RNA
Long non-coding RNAs (long ncRNAs or lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule that are longer than 200 nucleotides in length and do not encode proteins, unlike traditional messenger RNAs (mRNAs) which are translated into proteins.
Some key characteristics and functions of long non-coding RNAs include:

Regulation of Gene Expression: LncRNAs can influence gene expression by interacting with DNA, RNA, and proteins. They can act as transcriptional activators or repressors by targeting specific genes and affecting their transcription levels.

Epigenetic Regulation: LncRNAs can play a role in modifying the chromatin structure and influencing epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. This can have a significant impact on gene expression patterns.

RNA Processing and Splicing: LncRNAs can be involved in alternative splicing and RNA processing events, affecting the final composition of mature RNAs and the proteins they encode.

Subcellular Localization: LncRNAs can localize to specific subcellular compartments, such as the nucleus or cytoplasm, and interact with other cellular components to influence various biological processes.

Cellular Signaling: LncRNAs can act as molecular signals, participating in cell signaling pathways and responses to external stimuli.

Disease Association: Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been linked to various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and more. Some lncRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Structural and Functional Diversity: LncRNAs exhibit a wide range of structural motifs and secondary structures, allowing them to interact with a diverse set of molecules and carry out various functions.

Evolutionary Conservation: While many lncRNAs are not conserved across species to the same extent as protein-coding genes, some lncRNAs do show evolutionary conservation, suggesting functional significance.

Research into lncRNAs is an evolving field, and scientists continue to uncover new roles and mechanisms by which these molecules influence cellular processes. Despite their name, lncRNAs play intricate and important roles in the regulation of gene expression and cellular function, contributing to the complexity of molecular biology.
